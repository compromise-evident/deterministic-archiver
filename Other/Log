Version 2.0.0   Not limited by the max number of files that can be open at once.
                The Linux kernel allows only 1024 in_stream at once.   There are
                things you can do, there are servers who can read from 1,000,000
                files by having each one open simultaneously,   but Linux limits
                you because otherwise,  an older computer might crash somewhere.
                That's no fucking excuse! Let it crash so it can be replaced!
